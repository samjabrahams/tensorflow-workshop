    "# Viewing Pre-Defined Models in TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow has some nifty features that make it easy to export and import models into your code. This can be useful to quickly retrain models, explore other people's work, and chain together separate models. To load in a saved graph, we can use a `tf.GraphDef` to help us out.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a GraphDef?\n",
    "\n",
    "A `GraphDef` is a TensorFlow class dedicated to storing a serialized form of a TensorFlow `Graph`. Once a `GraphDef` is loaded (either from disk or from the `Graph.as_graph_def()` function), you can transfer its data into a graph by using the `tf.import_graph_def()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to read/write `GraphDef` objects from disk, you use a compiled protocol buffer file. To read in the file, you use the `GraphDef.ParseFromString()` method, which takes in a byte string object. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('my_graph.pb', 'rb') as f:\n",
    "    graph_def = tf.GraphDef()\n",
    "    graph_def.ParseFromString(f.read())\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "To write the file to disk, you use the `GraphDef.SerializeToString()` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "with open('new_graph.pb', 'wb') as f:\n",
    "    graph_def = my_existing_graph.as_graph_def()\n",
    "    f.write(graph_def.SerializeToString())\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ...and what is a Protocol Buffer?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), sometimes shortened to protobufs, are an extensible, structured way of communicating data. They're in the same family as XML or JSON, but with some extra features. One such feature is the ability to compile it to binary and read it back with included open source software. It's backed by Google, who are planning on using it for all of their APIs in the near future.\n",

    "\n",
    "* [Inception v1: GoogLeNet](http://www.cs.unc.edu/~wliu/papers/GoogLeNet.pdf)\n",

    "You can see that it's a long series of various convolutions and pools before getting to the final few steps. Google's been kind enough to provide a pre-trained version of Inception v3 in TensorFlow, so we're going to load it up and visualize the graph using TensorFlow's built-in TensorBoard utility."
